# Excel Dashboards

### Created advance dashboards with Excel with Maven Analytics.

#### Major takeaway from the course was the use to dashboard designs.  
The theory behind creating the dashboard, but also manipulating the data with VLOOKUP, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, IF, MATCH, MIN, MAX AND SUM statements.  The ability to create automative dashboards with these functions is amazing and made the dashboard a tool that can be used multiple times. The focus during the course was making sure your answer the problem, but also knowing who the audience is throughout the design process.
